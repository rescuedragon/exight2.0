# Phase 1: AWS Account Setup Complete! üéâ

## ‚úÖ Account Creation Status: DONE!

Congratulations! Your AWS account has been created and is being activated.

## üîÑ Next Steps (Do These Once Account is Active):

### Step 1: Access AWS Management Console

1. **Wait for confirmation email** (2-10 minutes)
2. **Click "Go to the AWS Management Console"** or go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com
3. **Sign in** with your email and password
4. **You should see the AWS Console Dashboard** (looks like a control panel with lots of service icons)

### Step 2: Set Up Billing Alerts (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

Once you're in the AWS Console:

1. **In the top search bar**, type "Billing" and press Enter
2. **Click "Billing and Cost Management"**
3. **In the left sidebar**, click "Budgets"
4. **Click "Create budget"**
5. **Choose "Cost budget"**
6. **Set budget amount to $5.00**
7. **Add your email** for alerts
8. **Click "Create budget"**

This protects you from any accidental charges!

### Step 3: Explore the Console

Take a moment to look around:

- **Services menu** (top left) - shows all AWS services
- **Region selector** (top right) - we'll use "US East (N. Virginia)" or your closest region
- **Account menu** (top right) - your account settings

### Step 4: Verify Free Tier Status

1. **Search for "Free Tier"** in the top search bar
2. **Click "AWS Free Tier"**
3. **You should see your free tier usage** (should be mostly empty/green since you just started)

## üéØ What We'll Do Next (Phase 2):

Once you confirm you can access the AWS Console, we'll:

1. **Create your EC2 server** (your web server)
2. **Set up the database** (PostgreSQL for your data)
3. **Configure security settings**
4. **Get your server ready** for the application

## üìß Expected Emails:

You should receive 2-3 emails from AWS:

1. **"Welcome to Amazon Web Services"** - Account confirmation
2. **"Your AWS Account is Ready"** - Account fully activated
3. **Possibly a billing/free tier welcome email**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- **Don't create any services yet** - wait for my guidance
- **Don't worry about the overwhelming number of services** - we'll only use 2-3 of them
- **The console might look complex** - that's normal, we'll focus on just what we need

## üö® If You Have Issues:

- **Account not ready yet**: Wait 10-15 more minutes, then try again
- **Can't sign in**: Double-check email and password
- **Console looks different**: AWS updates their interface, but core functionality stays the same

## ‚úÖ Confirmation Checklist:

Once you're in the AWS Console, confirm you can see:

- [ ] AWS Management Console dashboard
- [ ] Services menu in top navigation
- [ ] Your account name in top right corner
- [ ] Region selector showing a region name
- [ ] Free Tier dashboard (search for "Free Tier")

**Let me know when you:**

1. ‚úÖ Receive the confirmation email
2. ‚úÖ Can access the AWS Management Console
3. ‚úÖ Have set up the $5 billing alert
4. ‚úÖ Can see the Free Tier dashboard

Then we'll move to Phase 2: Creating Your Server! üöÄ
