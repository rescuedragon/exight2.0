# AWS Deployment & Backend API Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for deploying the Exight expense tracker application to AWS with a complete backend API system. The goal is to transform the current localStorage-based application into a full-stack web application with user authentication, data persistence, and cloud hosting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AWS Infrastructure Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up AWS infrastructure so that I can host my application in the cloud with minimal cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up AWS account THEN I SHALL use the AWS Free Tier for 12 months
2. WHEN choosing compute service THEN I SHALL use EC2 t2.micro instance (free tier eligible)
3. WHEN setting up database THEN I SHALL use RDS PostgreSQL db.t3.micro (free tier eligible)
4. WHEN configuring networking THEN I SHALL set up VPC, security groups, and load balancer
5. WHEN setting up domain THEN I SHALL configure Route 53 for DNS management
6. WHEN implementing SSL THEN I SHALL use AWS Certificate Manager for HTTPS

### Requirement 2: Backend API Development

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create REST APIs so that the frontend can communicate with the database securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating backend THEN I SHALL use Node.js with Express.js framework
2. WHEN implementing authentication THEN I SHALL use JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
3. WHEN designing API endpoints THEN I SHALL follow RESTful conventions
4. WHEN handling errors THEN I SHALL implement proper error handling and logging
5. WHEN validating data THEN I SHALL use input validation middleware
6. WHEN implementing CORS THEN I SHALL configure proper cross-origin policies

### Requirement 3: Database Schema Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to design a proper database schema so that user data is stored efficiently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating users table THEN I SHALL include id, email, password_hash, name, created_at, updated_at
2. WHEN creating expenses table THEN I SHALL include all fields from current Expense interface plus user_id foreign key
3. WHEN creating loans table THEN I SHALL include all fields from current Loan interface plus user_id foreign key
4. WHEN creating partial_payments table THEN I SHALL normalize payment data with expense_id foreign key
5. WHEN creating loan_payments table THEN I SHALL normalize payment data with loan_id foreign key
6. WHEN implementing relationships THEN I SHALL use proper foreign key constraints

### Requirement 4: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and login securely so that my financial data is private and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering THEN I SHALL provide email, password, and full name
2. WHEN logging in THEN I SHALL use email and password credentials
3. WHEN password is stored THEN IT SHALL be hashed using bcrypt
4. WHEN authenticated THEN I SHALL receive a JWT token
5. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN I SHALL provide valid JWT token
6. WHEN token expires THEN I SHALL be redirected to login page

### Requirement 5: API Endpoints Implementation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want well-defined API endpoints so that I can integrate the backend with the existing React application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing auth endpoints THEN I SHALL create POST /api/auth/register, POST /api/auth/login, POST /api/auth/logout
2. WHEN implementing expense endpoints THEN I SHALL create GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/expenses
3. WHEN implementing loan endpoints THEN I SHALL create GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/loans
4. WHEN implementing user endpoints THEN I SHALL create GET/PUT /api/user/profile
5. WHEN implementing dashboard endpoints THEN I SHALL create GET /api/dashboard/summary
6. WHEN implementing all endpoints THEN THEY SHALL require authentication except register/login

### Requirement 6: Frontend Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly with the backend so that my data is automatically saved and synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating frontend THEN I SHALL replace localStorage with API calls
2. WHEN implementing auth flow THEN I SHALL add login/register forms
3. WHEN handling API responses THEN I SHALL implement proper loading states
4. WHEN errors occur THEN I SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN offline THEN I SHALL show appropriate offline indicators
6. WHEN data changes THEN I SHALL automatically sync with backend

### Requirement 7: Deployment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy both frontend and backend so that users can access the application via a public URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying backend THEN I SHALL use PM2 for process management
2. WHEN deploying frontend THEN I SHALL build optimized production bundle
3. WHEN configuring web server THEN I SHALL use Nginx as reverse proxy
4. WHEN setting up CI/CD THEN I SHALL use GitHub Actions for automated deployment
5. WHEN configuring environment THEN I SHALL use environment variables for secrets
6. WHEN monitoring THEN I SHALL set up basic logging and health checks

### Requirement 8: Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my financial data to be secure so that my privacy is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transmitting data THEN ALL communication SHALL use HTTPS
2. WHEN storing passwords THEN THEY SHALL be hashed with salt
3. WHEN implementing API access THEN I SHALL use rate limiting
4. WHEN validating input THEN I SHALL sanitize all user inputs
5. WHEN handling errors THEN I SHALL not expose sensitive information
6. WHEN configuring database THEN I SHALL use encrypted connections

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly so that I have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving static files THEN I SHALL use CDN or optimized caching
2. WHEN querying database THEN I SHALL implement proper indexing
3. WHEN loading data THEN I SHALL implement pagination for large datasets
4. WHEN bundling frontend THEN I SHALL optimize bundle size
5. WHEN implementing API THEN I SHALL use response compression
6. WHEN caching THEN I SHALL implement appropriate cache headers

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor the application so that I can ensure it runs smoothly and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing logging THEN I SHALL log all important events and errors
2. WHEN monitoring performance THEN I SHALL track response times and error rates
3. WHEN backing up data THEN I SHALL implement automated database backups
