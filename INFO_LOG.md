### [$(date)] - Database Issue Identified - AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- **Root Cause Found**: HTTP 400 error related to database connectivity
- **Database Details**:
  - **Type**: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS
  - **Instance**: database-1 (db.t4g.micro)
  - **Endpoint**: database-1.cfiiymea6yya.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432
